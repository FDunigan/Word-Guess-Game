# Hangman Trivia (JavaScript)

I created a hangman game featuring dynamic HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The theme is classic rock, with five different bands to choose from. 

When a user guesses the band correctly, one of the particular band's songs will play. When incorrect, the user will hear the iconic failure noise from The Price is Right. 

The user will be allowed 10 guesses, with each incorrect letter populating next to the word they must guess.
